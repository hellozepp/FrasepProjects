# Convert CAS Server Definitions for Migration

## Overview

This readme describes how to convert SAS Viya 3.x CAS server definitions into
SAS Viya 4 Custom Resources (CR) using the sas-migration-cas-converter.sh script.

## Prerequisites

To convert SAS Viya 3.x CAS servers into compatible SAS Viya 4 CRs, you must
first run the inventory playbook to create a migration package. The package will
contain a YAML file with the name of each of your CAS servers, such as
cas-shared-default.yaml. Instructions to create a migration package using
this playbook are given in the SAS Viya Administration Guide.

You perform the conversion process by specifying the name of the YAML file as an
argument to the sas-migration-cas-converter.sh script. You can specify the `-f`
or `--file` argument. You can specify the `-o` or `--output` option to specify
the location of the output file for the converted custom resource. By default,
if no output option is specified, the YAML file is created in the current
directory.

When you run the conversion script, a file with the custom resource is created
in the format of {{ CAS-SERVER-NAME }}-migration-cr.yaml.

## Restoring from a Backup Location

If you have data and permstore content to restore, use the `cas-migration.yaml`
patch in `\$deploy/sas-bases/examples/migration/cas/cas-components` to specify
the backup location to restore from. This patch is already included in the
kustomization.yaml file in the `cas-components` directory. To configure this
patch:

1. Open cas-migration.yaml to modify its contents.

2. Set up the NFS mount by replacing the NFS-MOUNT-PATH and NFS-SERVER tokens
   with the mounted path to your backup location and the NFS server where it
   lives:

   ```yaml
   nfs:
     path: {{NFS-MOUNT-PATH}}
     server: {{NFS-SERVER}}
   ```

3. To include the newly created CAS custom resource in the manifest, add a
   reference to it in the resources block of the base kustomization.yaml file
   (there is an example commented out). After you run `kustomize build` and
   apply the manifest, your server is created. Your backup content is restored
   if you included the cas-migration.yaml patch with a valid backup location.

## Example

Run the script:

```bash
./sas-migration-cas-converter.sh -f cas-shared-default.yaml -o .
```

The output from this command is a file named
`cas-shared-default-migration-cr.yaml`.
