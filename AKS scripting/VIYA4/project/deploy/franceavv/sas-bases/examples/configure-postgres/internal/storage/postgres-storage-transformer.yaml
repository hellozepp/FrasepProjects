## Example postgres-storage-transformer to set storage on your Kubernetes cluster.
##   - Internal PostgreSQL only.
##   - This transformer does not apply if you opted for an external PostgreSQL instance. 
##   - In the following code, user-defined values are indicated by a capitalized and
##     hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. To replace
##     the variable, replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable
##     name. For instance, {{ STORAGE-SIZE-IN-GB }} could be replaced by 128Gi.
##   - If there are two number signs, remove only the first. 
##     Make sure block comments are aligned with the yaml data structure.
