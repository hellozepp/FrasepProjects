# Example postgres-custom-config when default to SAS Provided Postgres custom configuration.
#   - Set on your Kubernetes cluster.
#   - Internal PostgreSQL only. 
#   - This generator does not apply if you opted for an external PostgreSQL instance. 
#   - In the following code, user-defined values are indicated by a capitalized and
#     hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. To replace
#     the variable, replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name. 
#     For instance, 
#        {{ HBA-CONF-HOST-OR-HOSTSSL }} should be replaced by hostssl when SSL is on or host when SSL is off.
#        {{ PASSWORD-ENCRYPTION }} should be replaced by md5 or scram-sha-256.
#   - Keep all other values as is and change only as needed.
